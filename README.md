# Bike-sharing-dataset
This project analyzes the usage patterns of the **Capital Bikeshare system** using environmental, seasonal, and temporal factors. The dashboard is built using **Streamlit** to visualize how weather conditions, weekdays, weekends, and user behavior (casual vs registered users) affect bike rental usage.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (if clustering is used)
- Streamlit

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn streamlit
